This program is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning application. It allows users to upload their own dataset or use a sample dataset for analysis. The program uses the Streamlit library to create an interactive web application.

The application offers several features:

Data Upload: Users can upload their own CSV file or use a sample dataset (tips or titanic).

EDA Analysis: Users can perform basic EDA analysis on the dataset, including viewing the dataset overview, basic statistics, pairplot, and correlation matrix.

Data Plotting: Users can select columns to plot. The program supports histogram, bar, and scatter plots based on the data type of the selected columns.

Machine Learning Tasks: Users can select feature columns and a target column to perform machine learning tasks. The program supports both regression and classification tasks.

Data Encoding: Users can encode categorical columns using Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding.

Train-Test Split: Users can select the train-test split ratio.

Model Selection and Evaluation: Users can select multiple regression or classification models to train on the dataset. The program evaluates the models and displays the best and worst models based on Mean Squared Error and R2 Score for regression tasks, and Accuracy and F1-Score for classification tasks.

The application also includes a sidebar with a link to the developer's LinkedIn profile. The main menu of Streamlit is hidden for a cleaner user interface.
